# hearthstone-randomizer
This is a Raspberry Pi-based card randomizer for a hardcopy version of Hearthstone

This is a way to manage the RNG aspects of Hearthstone for a hardcopy version of the game.

This only has cards through the League of Explorers expansion.

This was written for a Raspberry Pi B+ with an Adafruit 16x2 Negative LCD + Keypad shield.

Set the script to run on boot and it should be good to go out of the box!

I would like to add the mana cost to the front of the card descriptions in the next version.  Additional card sets may be added, but there are a lot of cards post-LOE that would be hard to manage in a physical environment, so I haven't acquired any additional expansions.
